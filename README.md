> ℹ️ **Unofficial** — an independent, community integration, not affiliated with or endorsed by BITZER, Lodam, or Ensy. It works by replaying the same calls the vendor's web app makes — a reverse-engineered client, not a documented API — so it can break if the platform changes. Use at your own risk.

Sign in with your existing Bitzer Smart Connect account and your ventilation unit shows up in Home Assistant with live, native entities — ready for dashboards, history, and automations.

## 🧭 Why this exists

If you own an Ensy InoVent, you may have noticed the app quietly stopped controlling it. Ensy moved these units onto the Bitzer Smart Connect platform, but the old Ensy app and its cloud (`app.ensy.no`) were left pointing at the previous backend — it still shows stale readings, yet commands go nowhere.

The earlier [_makstech/ensy-home-assistant_](https://github.com/makstech/ensy-home-assistant) integration talked to that same old cloud, so it stopped working too. This project talks to the backend the units actually use now — and it's built generically, so it isn't tied to Ensy: any device on the Bitzer Smart Connect / Lodam platform should work.

## ✨ Features

- 🌡️ **Climate control** — target temperature and fan speed in one card.
- 📈 **Live sensors** — supply, extract, outdoor and other temperatures, plus **humidity** and **CO₂**.
- 🔔 **Alarms & status** — filter-change and fault alerts, using the device's own readable labels.
- ⚡ **Real-time** — changes appear within a few seconds over the cloud's live connection, backed by a gentle refresh so state stays in sync.
- 🎛️ **Per-model profiles** — sensible fan/temperature ranges for known units (like the Ensy InoVent), with a generic fallback for everything else.
- 🔄 **Reauth** — if your password changes, Home Assistant just asks you to sign in again.

## 📦 Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=makstech&repository=ha-bitzer-smart-connect&category=integration)

Click the badge above, or add it manually:

1. In HACS, open the menu → **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/makstech/ha-bitzer-smart-connect` with category **Integration**.
3. Search for **Bitzer Smart Connect**, download, and restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Bitzer Smart Connect**.

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Enter the **email and password** you use at [bitzersmartconnect.com](https://www.bitzersmartconnect.com).
2. Pick your device from the list — or, if none appear, enter the device ID from the web app URL (the number after `/configurations/`).

Add the integration again for each additional device.

## 🎛️ Options

There are settings worth knowing about — and they live in an easy-to-miss spot. Open **Settings → Devices & Services → Bitzer Smart Connect → ⚙️ Configure**:

- **Fan / temperature limit overrides** — if your unit's real range is narrower than the controller's raw range, set the exact min/max/step here.
- **Poll interval** — how often the background refresh runs (the live connection still delivers instant updates).
- **Expose all parameters** — also create entities for every configuration parameter the controller has. Off by default; they arrive disabled, enable the ones you want.

Prefer to fix your model's limits for *everyone*? Add a device profile:

1. Find your **product ID** — the GUID in the app's `…/api/Localization/ProductStrings/<id>` request (also reported as `productId`).
2. Add an entry keyed by it to `custom_components/bitzer_smart_connect/profiles.py`.

Pull requests with new device profiles are very welcome. 🙌

## 🔧 How it works

- **Sign-in** replays the web app's own login with your email and password to get the API session.
- **Live updates** arrive over the platform's SignalR WebSocket — whether the change came from you, another app, or the unit itself — within a few seconds.
- **Background refresh** re-reads the full parameter set on a gentle interval as a safety net, even while the live connection is healthy.
- **Commands** are a single batched write to the same endpoint the web app uses, confirmed when the cloud echoes the change back.

## ⚠️ Limitations & privacy

- **Cloud-dependent** — there's no local/offline mode; if the cloud is unreachable, so is this.
- **Unofficial API** — reverse-engineered from the web app, not a published one; it can change without notice.
- **Your login is stored** encrypted by Home Assistant and sent only to `bitzersmartconnect.com`.
- **Command lag** — expect a few seconds (~3–8s) before a change takes effect; the cloud confirms it.
- **Your own account and devices** — please don't use it to manage others' equipment or hammer the servers.

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome — especially reports and device profiles from other Bitzer Smart Connect / Lodam devices beyond the Ensy InoVent this was built against.
